**Problem 1.** (Pages 78-79, Figs 3.9-3.12)

Consider the following equation
$$
u_t = u_{xx} + u_{yy} \quad \text{for } t > 0, (x, y) \in \Omega,
$$
where the domain $\Omega$ is defined as the region between the unit square and a circle. Specifically,
$$
\Omega = \{(x, y) | (x, y) \in [0, 1] \times [0,1], \quad ||(x - \frac{1}{2}, y - \frac{1}{2})|| > 0.33\}.
$$
On the part of the domain above the line $x + y = 1$, the boundary condition specifies that $u=0$ on the two straight sides of the domain and also on this half of the interior circle. On the other parts of the boundary, where $x + y < 1$, the boundary condition specifies that the normal derivative is zero. Thus
$$
u(x, y, t) = 0 \text{ on } \{x + y \geq 1\} \cap \partial\Omega,
$$
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = 0 \text{ on } \{x + y < 1\} \cap \partial\Omega.
$$
The initial condition $u(x, y, 0)$ consists of two parabolic peaks centered at the points $(x_1, y_1) = (0.14, 0.14)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (0.86, 0.86)$. Each peak has a maximum value of 1 at its center and smoothly decreases to 0 within a radius $r = 0.08$ and outside these circular regions, $u(x, y, 0) = 0$, i.e.,
$$
u(x, y, 0) = \max(0, 1 - a((x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2)) + \max(0, 1 - a((x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2)) \quad \text{for } (x,y) \in \Omega,
$$
where $a = \frac{1}{0.08^2} = 156.25$.

Program to solve this problem using the Peaceman-Rachford ADI method with the following parameters
$$
\Delta x = \Delta y = 0.02, \quad \Delta t = 0.0001,
$$
and plot the numerical solutions at $t=0, t=0.005, t=0.02, \text{ and } t=0.05$ as shown in Fig 3.9-Fig 3.12.

**Problem 2.** (Page 99, Fig 4.6)

Consider the following equation
$$
u_t + a(x, t)u_x = 0, \quad x \geq 0, t \geq 0, \quad (1)
$$
where
$$
a(x, t) = \frac{1+x^2}{1+2xt+2x^2+x^4}, \quad (2)
$$
with the initial condition
$$
u(x, 0) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } 0.2 \leq x \leq 0.4, \\
0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\quad (3)
$$
and the boundary condition
$$
u(0, t) = 0. \quad (4)
$$
Program to solve this equation using the upwind scheme with the following two sets of parameters
1) $\Delta t = \Delta x = 0.01$,
2) $\Delta t = \Delta x = 0.02$,

and plot the numerical solutions at $t=0, t=0.1, t=0.5, \text{ and } t=1$ for each set of parameters. You need to determine the range of $x$ to show the important parts of the solution as shown in Fig 4.6.

**Problem 3.** (Page 102, Fig 4.7)

Program to solve the same problem (1)-(4) in Problem 2 using the Lax-Wendroff method with the following two sets of parameters
1) $\Delta t = \Delta x = 0.01$,
2) $\Delta t = \Delta x = 0.02$,

and plot the numerical solutions at $t=0, t=0.1, t=0.5, \text{ and } t=1$ for each set of parameters. You need to determine the range of $x$ to show the important parts of the solution as shown in Fig 4.7.
